My new role
       - now that i am in college, i have to be more responsible as a student and study harder, and at the same time have fun.   i should help my blockmates if they are in need so that i may contribute something to the block.

     My new routine
       - things have been very different so far, now i always have to ride the lrt to go to my school , and because my school has no uniform i get to wear lots of different things everyday. These days i go to a computer shop to play Defense of the Ancients , after so long of not playing i decided to play again so that i can have fun with my blockmates.

     My new relationship
       - I met new people like mary tyler brillo, jamaica balbin, alexandra vuycankiat, TJ quing, ryan titong, bate, cj lapuz, blue, carlo yao, dimitri, martin lao, amir lim, herrera, arvin cabang, biscocho, mark antolin, isabel gomez, eloisa chen, shari lee, jay del valle, jeric cruz, david, samantha, jonas, jeremy plana, lee baldo, abboc, jeffrey so, alejandro and some of them are now my friends.
